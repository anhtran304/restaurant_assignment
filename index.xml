                        <strong>What does Swap do?</strong> 
                        Swap is a leading digital cross border payments company which enables consumers, Small and Medium Enterprises and financial institutions to make international money transfers at a low cost. We were founded in 2014 in Singapore with licenses and offices in Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, India, USA, Canada and EU.

                        <strong>Why use Swap over a bank or any other Money Transfer Operator (MTO)?</strong>
                        Transferring money overseas through banks and MTOs can be an expensive affair since they add unfair margins to FX rates and have hidden fees. Sometimes it's not even clear what the recipient's actually going to receive! At Swap, we are bringing transparency to the otherwise obscure world of international money transfers. We offer Zero-Margin FX rates, mid-market rates sourced directly from Reuters, and add no margin to it. We only charge a nominal fee to cover the cost of processing your transaction. We also maintain complete transparency and give you an accurate breakup of your transfer. In fact World Bank remittance site has consistently rated Swap as #1 cost-effective money transfer provider from Australia and Singapore to multiple countries.

                        <strong>How much fees does Swap charge?</strong>
